<em>One Taste at a Time</em> is a food-based social networking site, focused on bringing the art of critiquing food to the masses. At One Taste, everyone has the ability to be a well-known critic.

This app allows a user to leave reviews for restaurants, and have their review evaluated by their peers for accuracy and consistancy. Once a review has been posted, it is able to be voted on.

A reviewer's standing is weighted on the total amount of votes their reviews have received, allowing all of their votes to appear higher on review lists. This enables the best reviewers to be the first thing prospective diners see when they are viewing the profile of a restaurant they want to try.

Now, your opinion really does matter... or maybe not.
